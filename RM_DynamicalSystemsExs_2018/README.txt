3 Exercises:
*    Ex_1_2.nb: a study of the “tongues of stability” of the upper unstable equilibrium of the pendulum with periodically-forced support. Moreover, there’s the study of the lower unstable equilibrium of pendulum with variable length;

*    Ex_2_recently_developments.nb: barely commented, but it follows straightforwardly from the “Ex_1_2.nb”; 

*    Ex_3.nb: is present a study of the chaotic motions of a pendulum.
